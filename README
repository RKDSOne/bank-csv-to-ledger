This project converts a CSV file of the list of bank transactions to
jwiegley's Ledger format.

The input is a CSV file, such as that downloaded from your bank.
The format of the CSV file is DATE,DESCRIPTION,AMOUNT
for example:

16/04/2011,XERO LIVE LTD          LONDON SE1    GB ,-28.80

The program reads a rule file, that determines how to treat each
entry.  The rules file (by default ~/bank-csv-to-ledger/rules.txt)
contains entries such as the following:

Rule:
  Name: Xero
  Conditions:
    DESC STARTS_WITH "XERO LIVE"
  Allocations:
    "Expenses:VAT Purchases:Accountancy" 100% "VAT:VAT Paid (Purchases)" 20%


This rule matches the above CSV row, and will output the following
Ledger formatted entry:

2011-04-16	XERO LIVE LTD          LONDON SE1    GB 
	Bank Accounts:Credit Card	-28.80
	Expenses:VAT Purchases:Accountancy	23.04
	VAT:VAT Paid (Purchases)	5.76

The program is run by specifying the CSV file, and the name of the account the CSV file corresponds to on the command line. For example:

./bank-csv-to-ledger.py statement_credit_card.csv "Bank Accounts:Credit Card"

The program outputs to stdout, so you will probably want to append to
your ledger file:

./bank-csv-to-ledger.py statement_credit_card.csv "Bank Accounts:Credit Card" >> ledger.txt
